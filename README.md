# Three Card Monte (currently under construction)

<em>Three Card Monte</em> is a browser game based off of the well-known card game of the same name, Three Card Monte (aka the "find/follow the card game").

## How To Play

- There are 3 cards laid face down before you.

- Tell the dealer to move the cards whenever you are ready to play.

- A "target card" is identified and its face side is revealed.

- Keep your eyes on the "target card"! All 3 cards will then immediately be rearranged before you.

- Once the cards stop moving, select the card that you believe is the "target card".

- If you selected the "target card", you win! If your selection was incorrect, you lose.

- Good luck!
